How to Play
============

Differs for each level but same basic concept(Dont let the object go past you). This is a two player game(You need 2 people to play). 
Note: There is no AI implemeneted.

Pong Level:
Use Up and Down to move your paddle. The game will continue on forever until you pause and exit the level.

Duck Hunt Level:
Use Up and Down to move your paddle. There are only 10 ducks. Each player has 3 options(each with their limited number of uses) 
at their disposal.

- Pressing X releases 6 clouds that the duck might bounce off of. When the opponent's paddle touches the clouds,
their paddle speed is reduced by 30% for EACH cloud.

- Pressing A release another duck random left or right. There can only be two ducks in place at once.

- Pressing B is the gun shot. Any ducks that are in play have their y-velocities reverse and gain a 50% speed boost.
